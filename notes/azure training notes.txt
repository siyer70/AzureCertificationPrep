Unmanaged disks
- need to create storage account

Managed disks
- no need to create storage account
- specify the type (standard/premium) and size of the disk

Managed disks benefits over Unmanaged disks
- Storage unit isolation ensuring high availability
	- in case of unmanged disk - if you create 3 vms using separate storage accounts in an availability set 
	  under the hood it is using the same storage unit
	- in case of manged disk - if you create 3 vms using separate storage accounts in an availability set 
	  under the hood azure ensures that they are stored in distinct storage unit resulting in high availability

- while creating custom images, managed disks captures the vm and internally copies all the vhds in the image
  enabling easier creation of vms from the images without any hastles where as unmanged disks you would need to 
  copy the vhds in the storage account yourself and create multiple copies of it depending on the number of vms to create

- independent snapshots of single managed disk can be created - that can be used for the following:
	- parent disks can be deleted after taking the snapshot and can be recreated back from the snapshot - the snapshot
	  survives even after the parent disks are deleted
	- the snapshot can be copied to a RA-GRS storage account (automatically replicated in multiple regions)
	- point in time restoration can also be accomplished by using the snapshot to create managed disks
	- the snapshot can be used to create images which in turn can create new instances of vm

- upgrading from standard to premium or downgrading from premium to standard storage is easy in case of managed disks

Storage queue vs Service Bus
Storage queue - push or pop kind of operation
Service Bus - (Managed Service - supports queues topics (pub/sub)



General purpose storage
Disks, Table, queues, files





Blob
for storing blobs

Multiple Access policies can be defined for table storage
These policies are then assigned at the application level to the respective users

Azure Tables - drawbacks
Geographical redundancy

Service Bus
Supports namespaces - Different application can connect to different namespaces
massively scalable and high throughput 
queue - any one subscriber reads the message, it is removed from the queue



Differences

Relays - Bi-Directional
Notification - Broadcasting

Web Apps
Storages
Service Bus

SQL DB - PaaS (Sql Server, MySQL, Postgres)



IaM - Idenity and Access Management

Roles
=====
Owner
Contributor
Reader

Supported Protocols
SAML 2.0
WS-Federation 
OpenID Connect
OAuth 2.0

Employees / internal - AAD is the better option
B2B - Two Active directories will communicate via WS - Federation (trust is established) - charged per user
B2C - Consumer centric - Oauth2.0 is the better option - charged per million of authentication per month

Multi-factor authentication (OTP, Verification Email, calls)
AAD supports following MFA - Calls, Emails, Authenticator App

AD -> AAD sync (specific users, what information needs to be sync) - AD Connect tool can be used for sync

Password write back from AD -> AAD
Password write back form AAD (Premium version only) -> AD

But users needs to be added first in AD (on-premise)

Supports AD Graph API

Domain Controller - manages the domains (Domain is group of connected servers)

When you install AAD, you can use Domain Controller role or Directory service role

Hardware Security Module (HSM)

Covers Application Insights, Azure Diagnostics, Performance counter
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/diagnostics-performance-counters

Diagnostics

a. Covers web server diagnostics
	- Detailed Error Logging - (for HTTP status code that indicate a failure i.e >= 400)
	- Failed Request Tracing - 
		- trace of the IIS components used to process the request and the time taken 
		- useful if u r attempting to improve the site performance or isolate what is causing the specific http error returned
	- Web Server Logging
		- to trace overall site metrics - number of requests handled or how many from specific ip address etc
b. Covers Application Diagnostics
		- Capture information produced by web Application. 
		- ASP.NET can use System.Diagnostics.Trace class to log information (System.Diagnostics.Trace.TraceError)

Enabling Diagnostics for Web Apps in Azure App Service
Application Logging (FileSysetem) - automatically turns off after 12 hours
Application Logging (Blob) - needs storage account and container - retention period can be set here

Web Server Logging - Filesystem (allows FTP download) or Blob (Table storage or Blob Storage can be enabled) - retention period can be set

Application Logs - /LogFiles/Application/
Failed Request Logs - /LogFiles/W3SVC########/ (xml & xsl template)
Detailed Error Logs - /LogFiles/DetailedErrors/ (html files)
Web Server Logs - /LogFiles/http/RawLogs/
Deployment Logs - /LogFiles/Git

Scalability targets
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-performance-checklist#subheading16
answer to throttling issue - (503 i.e. server busy or 500 time out - use exponential back off solution (i.e. retry after 2, 4 10, 30 seconds)
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-performance-checklist#subheading14

CDN
Staggering the workload are other options
copy blobs across storage accounts (direct copy from one storage account to another)
use azcopy
use Azure import/export service
use metadata (limitation of 8KB rule)
upload in parallel (for fast uploads - for single blob, upload its blocks in parallel, for multiple blobs, upload them in parallel)

VM Scale Sets
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-placement-groups
supports upto 1000 vms (if single placement group is false and manage disks are used and market place images are used)
if use custom images, it is restricted to 300 vms
if single placement group is true or manage disk is not used, it is restricted to 100 vms


DevOps
	Reduce the cost (3 options)
		stop at end of the business day
		start at start of the business day
		limit number of vms per user
		predesignated vm size

		
Swasbuckle Metadata for all API methods (some options were)
	XML Comments
	IOperationFilter
	
Redis cluster

Service Bus

PCF
1. To check - Cloud shell to install cloud foundry CLI

Added database connection string in key vault
When an application error occurs, it displays the configuration details
Database credentials should not be displayed to end user - options were
a. custom domain and ssl
b. azure active directory app
c. in web.config add pfx
d. x.509 certification using makecert

(May be the point is to encrypt the connection string)

Service bus connection
NameSpaceManager and NameSpaceManagerSettings
can use different constructors
NameSpaceManger.createFromConnectionString
NameSpaceManager(sburi, tokenprovder)
NameSpaceManager(uri, namespacemanagersettings())

see this example for the above
http://www.cloudcasts.net/devguide/Default.aspx?id=12018

PeekLock (two staged) - service will only mark the message as consume when it sees the complete() call from application
ReceiveAndDelete (single staged) - service will immediately mark the message as consumed as it forwards the message to the application

EnablePartitioning (high throughput and availability)
PreFetch (receive)
client side batching (send, complete)
batch store (writing to persistent store)
express (caching )

templates structure documentation
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/

(run book or arm templates seems to be the answer)

cosmos db
queries

azure search
multi-tenant azure search
A tenant would not like to share workload and data
B tenant would like to share workload but not data
which one should you use for each tenant
A - service per tenant
B - index per tenant

mixed model (active tenants are assigned dedicated search service where as smaller tenants will have 
shared service - index (data) is isolated for all tenants)

routine questions
always on (webjob not running)
storage api sequence (parse, createxxxclient, getxxxreference, createIfNotExists(), specific to resource)
throttling issue (server busy or timeout - retry (exponential backoff))
which storage service to use (SMB Files - Azure Files, Windows Event logs - Table service, Crash dumps - Blob Service)
Application Insight analytics (AIQL)
requests | where timestamp > ago(7d) | summarize avg(duration) by bin(timestamp, 30m)

PCF creation steps
Steps
1. storage account prefix - pcfsa
2. ssh public key (use puttygen to generate - puttygen is part of putty installation - look at the putty folder in program files)
3. select a service principal json file (d:\azure\pcf\sp\azure-credentials.json) that covers subscr id, tenant id, app id (service-principal), authentication key
4. get the pivotal network token (refresh token) from pivotal edit profile page (also called UAA-API-TOKEN)
5. create or specify the resource group 
6. select the location (central india for your organization where quota has been increased)

cf cli commands
===============
Help
cf help

Login
cf login -a https://api.run.pivotal.io

Push the app to PWS (Pivotal Web Services)
cf push

this will print the status of the push - look for routes: <your-application>-random-word.cfapps.io
for ex: cf-spring-brash-swan.cfapps.io

Access Log files
cf logs cf-spring --recent

Live Stream Logs
cf logs cf-spring

Access environment variables
cf env <your-app-name> for ex: cf env cf-spring

Look for services in marketplace - for example elephantSQL plans
cf marketplace -s elephantsql

(MongoDB HA instance)
cf marketplace -s mlab 

(Redis - paid service)
cf marketplace -s rediscloud 

(Rabbit MQ) 
cf marketplace -s cloudamqp 

Create service command for using elephantsql (turtle is a free tier) 
cf create-service elephantsql turtle cf-spring-db

Binding the newly created service to your app
cf bind-service cf-spring cf-spring-db

After binding environment variables are updated - use push or restage or restart command to see the changes in env variables
cf restart cf-spring

Verify the new service is bound to the app
cf services

Configure site to site connection
01. Create a Virtual Network and subnet
02. Specify DNS Server (Optional)
03. Create the gateway subnet (i.e. name should be GatewaySubnet - VPN Gateway internally uses this) 
		- typical cidr block xxx /27 or xxx /28 for ex: 10.1.255.0/27
04. Create the VPN Gateway (Virtual Network Gateway)
		- Name
		- Gateway Type = VPN (other option could be Express Route - but in this case we need to select VPN)
		- VPN type = Route Based (other option could be Policy Type)
		- SKU = VpnGw1 (30 max connections, 650 Mbps)
			- VpnGw2 (30 max connections, 1 Gbps)
			- VpnGw3 (30 max connections, 1.25 Gbps)
			- Basic (10 max connections, 100 Mbps)
		- Specify Virtual Network
		- Specify First IP Configuration (Public ip configuration)
		- Click Create Button
05. Create Local Network Gateway
		- Name (your on-premise Site Name - for ex: Site 1)
		- IP Address (Public IP Address of your on-premise VPN Devise that you want Azure connect)
		- Address Space (your on-premise local network address range - you can provide multi-address ranges without overlapping)
		- Configure BGP Settings (leave it unchecked)
		- Subscription
		- Location
		- Resource Group
		- Click Create Button
06. Configure Your VPN device
		- Specify the Shared key (common secret code - this will be used when creating site to site VPN connection)
		- The public IP Address of the Virtual Network Gateway (that we setup in step 4)
07. Create the VPN Connection (create the site-to-site vpn connection between your Virtual Network Gateway and on-premises VPN device)
		- Navigate to the virtual network gateway by going to your virtual nework -> overview -> connected devices -> select your vpn gateway
		- Click Add Connection
			- Name
			- Connection Type = Site to Site (IPSec)
			- Virtual network gateway
			- Local network gateway
			- Shared Key (see step 6 - Shared Key - this should have the same value)
			- Subscription
			- Location
			- Resource Group
			- Press OK
08. Verify the VPN Connection
