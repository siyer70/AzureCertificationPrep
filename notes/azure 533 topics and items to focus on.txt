Design and Implement Azure App Service Apps (10-15%)
====================================================
1. Deploy Web Apps
	a. Define deployment slots; roll back deployments; 
	b. implement pre- and post-deployment actions; 
	c. create, configure, and deploy packages; 
	d. create App Service plans; 
	e. migrate Web Apps between App Service plans; 
	f. create a Web App within an App Service plan; 
	g. determine when to use App Service Environment (ASE); 
	h. select and use appropriate deployment methods including Git, FTP, and cloud sync
2. Configure Web Apps
	a. Define and use app settings, connection strings, handlers, and virtual directories; 
	b. configure certificates and custom domains; 
	c. configure SSL bindings and runtime configurations; 
	d. manage Web Apps by using Azure PowerShell and Azure-CLI; 
	e. manage App Service backups; 
	f. configure authentication and authorisation for Web Apps; 
	g. configure Web App notifications
3. Configure diagnostics, monitoring and analytics
	a. Retrieve diagnostics data; 
	b. view streaming logs; 
	c. configure endpoint monitoring; 
	d. configure alerts; 
	e. configure diagnostics; 
	f. use remote debugging; 
	g. monitor Web App resources
4. Configure Web Apps for scale and resilience
	a. Configure auto-scale using built-in and custom schedules; 
	b. configure by metric; change the size of an instance; 
	c. configure Traffic Manager

To revise
1. Deploy Web Apps
	a. Practice Define deployment slots - try auto-swap, swap - roll back deployments; 
	b. read about implement pre- and post-deployment actions (possible scenarios and tools (see vsts release managment can be used))
	g. determine when to use App Service Environment (ASE); 
	h. select and use appropriate deployment methods including Git, FTP, and cloud sync
2. Configure Web Apps
	d. manage Web Apps by using Azure PowerShell and Azure-CLI
		- try creating webapp using Powershell, CLI, REST, ARM templates
		- create deployment slots via scripts, Deploy staging and production apps, swap production and staging and try rollback
	e. manage App Service backups; 
	f. configure authentication and authorisation for Web Apps; (try this out with all identity providers)
	g. configure Web App notifications
3. Configure diagnostics, monitoring and analytics (just revise the following)
	a. Retrieve diagnostics data; 
	c. configure endpoint monitoring; 
	d. configure alerts; 
	e. configure diagnostics; 
	g. monitor Web App resources
4. Configure Web Apps for scale and resilience
	a. Configure auto-scale using built-in and custom schedules; (just revise once)
	b. configure by metric; change the size of an instance; (just revise once)
	c. configure Traffic Manager (try this case as practical)
