	- Design microservices-based solutions (TODO)
		- Determine when a container-based solution is appropriate
			notes
				It is appropriate
				- when you are creating app with a micro service architecture
				- when Implementing DEVOPS practices (containers provide infrastructure as code)
				- when you desire 100% compatibility across on-premise, Azure and other cloud providers (containers run the same regardless)
				- for Agile delivery environments
		- determine when container-orchestration is appropriate
			notes
				- The task of automating and managing large number of containers and how they interact is known as Orchestration
				- It provides service such as 
					- Coordinated Deployments
					- Load Balancing
					- Automated FailOver
				- It is appropriate
					- in a multi-container situation with support for self healing scenarios (monitoring containers and restarting it when needed)
					- in a multi-container situation with support for horizontal scaling without administrator intervention
					- in a multi-container and multi-tiered applications, to scale at different times or based on some criteria
					- for load balancing multiple containers across a single DNS name
					- for container migrations or deployments
					- for applications that use microservice architecture
				- Simply, you need an Orchestrator, 
					- if you need to perform an action based on multiple containers
					- or work with applications having mulit-container architectures
		- determine when Azure Service Fabric (ASF) is appropriate
			notes
				- It is a distributed system platform that makes it easy to package, deploy and manage scalable and reliable microservices & containers.
				- It is ideal when orchestrating and deploying microservices in containers across a cluster of machines
				- It provides ultra-fast, highly available and scalable application fabric  
		- determine when Azure Functions is appropriate
			notes
				- It is most appropriate when
					- you want to run snippets of code
					- you want to use serverless infrastrcuture to run code snippets
					- integrate with third party apps
					- or run apps like Logic Apps
		- determine when to use API management service
			notes
				- Think of API Management as API Store
				- Use it
					- when you want to standardize how and when your developers use APIs
						- especially, if you dont have a great model for managing and streamlining the use of APIs
					- when you need a central repository for API Management
					- when you want to add, test, rollout or rollback API access for internal or external users
					- when you want to deploy an easy to use and fully authenticated portal for developers to use to request access to APIs
					- when you want to fully document APIs, their connection and call details and other details that can be easily provided to developers
					- when you want to monitor any aspect of API including
						- availability
						- performance
						- deep insights
						- request and response
				- In addition to managing your own APIs, you can also use it manage third party APIs that are used by your developers
				- You can gate access using API keys and applying advanced security policies (regardless where it is running)
		- determine when Web API is appropriate
			notes
			- Web API defines the resources, relationships, and navigation schemes accessible to client applications.
			use it
				- when you want to expose using REST actions of a web app. 
				- Some of these actions may include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or any other functions including custom functions. 

				- when you want to directly monitor your API. This includes availability, performance, usage data, and deep applications insights. 
				- Monitoring can also track information about requests, responses and more.				
			Web API is appropriate 
				- when you need these capabilities and you want to maintain responsiveness, scalability and availability across the requests.
